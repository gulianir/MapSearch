**Problem 6 - Answering Questions about the (Fibonacci) Code:** 10/15

- Question 1: 5/5

- Question 2: 0/5
  - Fibonacci failed the testBaseCase test because it threw an IllegalArgumentException when n=0 instead of returning 1.
    This problem was fixed when (n â‰¤0) was changed to (n<0) in the previous problem.

- Question 3: 5/5
  - Correct, but your answer from question 2 should also be here.
